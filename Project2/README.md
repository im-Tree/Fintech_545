# Project 02  
## **Description**
This repository contains the solution and code for Project 01. The repository includes:
- `project2.pdf`: A document containing the detailed answers and explanations for all the problems in the project.
- `project_2_code.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code used for the project.  
- `DailyPrices.csv`: Data file.  

## **File Structure**
```
|-- project2.pdf              # Contains the detailed answers for the project
|-- project_2_code.ipynb    # Code implementation for the project
|-- DailyPrices              # Data file  
```


## **Usage Instructions**


### **Running the Code**
1. **Place Required Files**:   
    Ensure `project_2_code.ipynb` and all required datasets are in the same directory.
2. **Import Required Libraries**:  
    Open the notebook and execute the **first code cell** to import all required libraries.
3. **Load Data**:   
    Each problem has a corresponding section (e.g., `Problem1`, `Problem2`).
    The dataset for each problem is loaded in the code cell immediately following the **Markdown cell** labeled with the problem name (e.g., `Problem1`).
4. **Run Problem-Specific Code**:  
    To run the code for a specific problem, navigate to the corresponding section, load the data first, and then execute the relevant code cells.
    


## **Notebook Organization**
- **Top Section**:   
    Contains all necessary library imports.
- **Markdown Cells**:  
    Each problem is clearly labeled with a **Markdown cell** (e.g., `Problem1`, `1A`, `2A`).
- **Code Cells**:  
    Following each Markdown cell, the dataset for the corresponding problem is loaded.
    The code for each problem is organized and self-contained under the respective section.
